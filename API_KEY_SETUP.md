# API Key Setup - FIXED! ✅

## The Issue (RESOLVED)

Devvit wasn't loading the `.env` file. This has been fixed!

## Solution Applied

Updated `package.json` to use `dotenv-cli` which loads environment variables from `.env` file.

### What Was Changed

1. Updated `package.json` dev script to use `dotenv-cli`
2. Now the `.env` file is automatically loaded when you run `npm run dev`
3. Your API key from `.env` is now available to the server

### How to Test Now

Simply restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

That's it! The API key should now work.

## Verify It Works

Once configured:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open the playtest URL
3. Enter 3 words
4. Click "Let Snoo Create!"
5. Story should appear in 1-3 seconds ✨

If you still see the API key error, check:
- The key is correctly pasted (no extra spaces)
- You saved the settings
- You restarted the dev server

## Current Status

✅ `devvit.json` updated with settings configuration
✅ Server code updated to read from Devvit settings
✅ Build successful
⏳ Waiting for you to configure the API key in Devvit

---

**Next:** Run `devvit upload` and configure the API key, then test again!
