## ❌ If Tests Fail

### Common Issues

**Issue: API key error**
```bash
# Check .env file exists
cat .env

# Should show:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# If missing, create it:
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key" > .env

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Issue: Build errors**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Issue: TypeScript errors**
```bash
# Check for errors
npm run type-check

# If errors appear, review the output and fix
```

**Issue: Stories don't generate**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check Gemini API key is valid
4. Verify API quota hasn't been exceeded

### Report Issues

If you encounter issues:
1. Note the exact error message
2. Check browser console (F12 → Console)
3. Check terminal for server errors
4. Take screenshots if visual issues
5. Document steps to reproduce
