# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Snoo Stories is a themed AI story generator for Reddit where Snoo (Reddit's mascot) takes 3 user-provided words and creates a funny, themed 10-word story. The theme automatically changes based on current events and holidays (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc.), providing a unique and engaging experience. Snoo guides users through the experience with expressive reactions and animations.

The app is built as a Devvit interactive post that runs natively on Reddit, powered by Google Gemini AI (free tier). It provides instant entertainment, encourages creativity, and is perfect for sharing stories in Reddit comments.
